				<h2>UMBRAL SIREN<br><u>Book One of The Compendium of the Astral</u></h2><br>
            <h3><span class="first-letter">A</span> remote town hidden within the fog is beset by the malevolent presence of a lone figure. Nine fighters from throughout the lands are driven here for their own reasons. Fury. Closure. Resurrection. Answers. Power. Desire. Self-Preservation. Loyalty. Vengeance. Their fates are meant to intersect here - but will they ever find what they are looking for in this desolate town?<br><br>

            Immerse yourself into a deep, twisting plot heavily inspired by cinematic story modes in fighting games such as Mortal Kombat and BlazBlue. Umbral Siren is an ambitious story filled with the intertwining narratives of a diverse array of characters - each with their own in-depth fighting styles, move-sets, and unique weapons that only serve to further immerse you into the universe.

            <h3>A resident of Vienna, Austria-Hungary, Simon Devereaux is a young and decorated private detective of the Herengasse Police Department. An earnest but arrogant man at the top of his field, Simon appears to be no more than the average crime investigator. One day, while on an assignment, Simon gets attacked by a masked assassin. On the brink of what looks to be certain death, Simon is saved by a mysterious woman in black by the name of Karin Varada. Her battle prowess beyond reason or doubt, Karin is a young witch belonging to an ancient order of powerful witches known as the Circle of Olori.<br><br>

Caught in a web of political intrigue beyond his understanding, Simon is forced head-long into a Noir-inspired thriller that combines 20th century pulp literature with supernatural occult horror, set within the early industrialized colonial period of World-War-One-Era Europe.<br><br>

The wheel of the future has begun to turn.<br><br>

And the story of the Astral - that of Simon and the mysterious woman Karin is about to begin.</h3><br><br><br><br>

                  <h3>Two divine forces wage a war across dimensions disrupting countless worlds from fulfilling their purposes.

                  The first in the Prime Covenant series, Pantheon Flights is an epic space-opera that combines vast and large-scale sci-fi with West African cosmology and spirituality into a timeless tale full of cosmic action, adventure, larger-than-life heroes and powerful adversaries.</h3><br><br>
