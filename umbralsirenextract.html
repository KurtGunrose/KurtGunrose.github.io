                <h3>The light was encompassing me. Safety, warmth, love, and compassion echoed all around my senses. I heard, I felt nothing but the light. I pushed the memories of pain and hurt out of my mind and thought, 'There is nothing else but this. This must be all there is, all there can be, all there needs to be. I felt as if I could reinvent my life's past to what I craved the most. Remember when you taught me to ride the bike? Or when I got a really good grade on that test? Those were the best days...just us three. I felt like there was no such thing as lies and that anything I said would be true. No matter what I did, or what I was going to do, I was already forgiven. My worlds are all gone, and there is just this. The most peace I had ever had, the most peace there could ever be, and the only thing that I have ever wanted.<br><br> 

 "Mother, Father, I -"<br><br>

The pain. The terrible pain. The years of torment, the pain of life with loss, isolation, trauma, and falsities rip through my head, my whole being. The light that has been encompassing me has now turned red and slowly ripping apart with tendrils of something awful. My paradise is falling apart, and I am helpless to stop it. The tendrils are grabbing out to reach me, pulling me down to their source; a lightless abyss. It was a hole at first, but as they draw me in closer, parts of it are beginning to fade down. Now I see what looks like a cross in front of me. One last, mind-wrenching bolt of pain strikes my head, making the new world dark, like the abyss.<br><br>

The smell of blood fills my senses first. Am I...kneeling? The floor is cold and grated. I hear monsters - the same that wandered my nightmares, and the sound of metal grinding against metal, and sometimes an unnerving crunch or watery noise. I finally opened my eyes and looked up. Before me, standing tall with her arms out as if protecting something, was a woman who looked as though she had been torn apart and put back together. There were great gaps of muscle uncovered on her arms and legs, her whole torso was covered with a pale sheet that almost blended with her skin, and her hair was so light, it seemed like an extension of her flesh. She looks at me with dark eyes and smiles. Her arms relax to her side.<br><br>

 "Did you believe your work was done?" She said. Her voice is like an angel and a devil at the same time, and it doesn't only come from her throat, but from the monsters as well. I realized there were more and more coming in, and that the metal was slowly corroding. I looked at the woman and stood up.<br><br>

 "I was so happy," I said calmly, though I didn't mean to. I still feel some serenity from where I had just been before. "Why did you take them from me?"<br><br>

 "Your parents nearly succeeded, you know. The rebirth was so close to being complete."<br><br>

 "Why did you bring me back here?"<br><br>

 "Even within death, I cannot stop. You and I both know Salvation must come. Soon."<br><br>

I'm starting to feel impatient, as my spiritual anesthesia is wearing off. "Why do you need me?" I look down and muttered, "I was finally with them..."<br><br>

 "To help bring forth the Old Gods, and Paradise. By ourselves, we had come so close, but failed. We mustn't end our goals there. We're special, you know. We have inherited this world, and with this power, we will succeed, together."<br><br> 
She turned around and started to walk away. She then stopped, turned her head and lost her smile. "The Old Gods demand terrible sacrifices. Their power is granted only to the heart of the worthy. There are nine individuals you must deal with. Each of them have the potential to wield the ultimate power." She started walking again. Her spine was exposed up to the top of her neck, and I could see its outline under the sheet. I thought of the stories I had heard as a child, and I wanted to tell her to leave. The words caught in my throat.<br><br>
 "How do I find them? How will I know? I've never seen them, only heard about them." That's not what I was trying to say...<br><br>
 "Trust in your teachings. You've been chosen for the rebirth. You are to be the Crimson One's vessel." She left, though there should have been nowhere for her to go. The corrosion keeps creeping towards me, and the monsters grow restless. "Make your decision," they said without truly saying. They're taunting me. Finally, I closed my eyes, letting myself adrift back to the real world, the normal world.<br><br>

I will have the nine weed each other out, so that I merely have the one fight with the sole victor. Then, nothing will stand in the way of my vengeance.<br><br> 

             We will all be together again...<br><br><br><br>

             ******<br><br><br><br>






                     Deep within the mountain wilderness of rural Maine, trees grow in odd shapes, three acres of it untouched for what must've been thousands of years. It was a dark, primal wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of decomposed oaks, of ironwoods as old as the region itself. People have been known to disappear, strange lights have been seen, and the wind seems to speak. There is always the ominous feeling of being watched. The sky vanishes almost completely, only a few fragments of grey remaining - like the scattered pieces of an impossible jigsaw puzzle. The air is rich with a miasma of moist earth and decay. Nothing new grew here. It had been at least decades since a footstep could be heard throughout its haunting borders.<br><br>
A tall and mysterious figure slowly traverses miles of this foreboding wilderness. The figure wears a tattered brown robe with its sleeves and ends appearing charred and disheveled. Apart from this, the only other piece of clothing the figure wears is light brown pants that show evident burns, leaving them ending at his knees. Various scars and strange sigils cover his body; particularly, his torso, bare-hands and feet. What skin can be seen is heavily scarred; the remainder of it in such a sickly pale tone, he had the appearance of a walking cadaver.<br><br> 
This would be a fitting description, as concealing his face was the hollowed-out skull of a horned beast. The skull looked fresh. In some places there was a pink sheen where flesh had been newly and inexpertly removed. There were tool marks gauged into recently-living bone, and a round-hole in the forehead of the skull. Its bottom jaw was missing entirely. At the rear, the head was cleaved open with a sharp blade of some kind. The femurs had been sliced and the marrow removed. Beneath the mask, the pale figure's eyes are nowhere to be seen - hidden under pitch-black voids that struck fear into whoever stared into him.<br><br>
In an open clearing of the forest, there is a circle deep within where nothing grows, and apparitions are seen. The grey sky ceaselessly looms, casting the silhouettes of two figures onto the surface of the damp earth. One was the pale hooded figure. The other was a mysterious figure concealed in a cloak standing amidst the clearing. From under his black hooded cloak, all that could be seen by the pale light of the forest clearing was the sliver of a long beard. Behind it was a long malevolent shadow that seemed to depict long matted hair and long twisted horns protrude outward towards the night sky. What little could be seen from beneath the cloak could not be called human.<br><br>
 "So you've come..." the horned figure snarled, not bothering to so much as turn and face the hooded man in the skull mask appearing before him.<br><br>
 "Hear these words, Crimson One. I have travelled through your lands, spoken your language, and your religion to summon you forth."<br><br>
 "The stink of arcane trickery overpowers even the foul stench of slit flesh. Yours is not so different from Vladimir's..."<br><br>
 "Hmm. I was unaware that you were familiar with that infamous fiend."<br><br>
 "It matters little. I have long watched your practices from afar. You are nothing but a peasant warlock. And your ritual is no more great and noble than the decrepit pale body your spirit possesses. State your business here or leave. I have little patience for the games of warlocks."<br><br>
 "I am Malakai - the master of this town and the emissary of the Old Gods. Perhaps, you have heard of them."<br><br>
 "Only 'civilized' individuals are unaware of the Old Gods, Warlock. If you are here to invite me to appeal to them as your ally, then forget it. I have no interest in the fates of others."<br><br>
 "Perhaps...but you aren't the only one who knows of their existence. There is one man of whom I am sure it's his fate you seek to hold in your hands. Or rather, his neck. Lesharo, is it?"<br><br>
When the horned figure in the black cloak didn't respond, the warlock continued. "It just so happens that he is on his way to attain the power of the Old Gods."<br><br>
"The creature that sleeps within Lesharo can sense my power. And it is afraid."<br><br>
"I admit, from the stories I have heard, he has quite the history."<br><br>
"It is the center of darkness and the source of all evil. His very existence is the world's worst nightmare. Only his death can put an end to that nightmare."<br><br>
 "But of course. His presence concerns me. Which brings me to why I am here, intruding upon your solitude. I would like to make you a deal."<br><br>
 "You would grant me a chance to kill the one who possesses the Dark Omen, in return for me fighting for your cause?"<br><br>
"Not quite. While I do offer you the opportunity to return for the role you were destined for, I am under no illusion that you intend to fight for me until the end. I will grant you your second chance, so long as you play by the rules laid down by the Old Gods. There are still others as well who seek their power as you do. However many you face until you are given your chance to slay Lesharo is dictated by their design. Whatever it takes, I ask that you do just that. Once Lesharo has been killed, then you will be free to stay or leave as you please."<br><br>
 "No doubt, we will be at opposite ends of the town - see to it that I face him in the perfect time and place."<br><br>
 "Of course. I may need your assistance, but I do not hand out charity. Still, should you perform well enough, I am sure the Old Gods would be willing to allow you to walk what remains of the Earth once it is cleansed by fire. Perhaps to walk it all the way to your precious Benin...and those that wait there for your return."<br><br>
Malakai's grin grew wide. There was no question that the warlock had hit upon the irresistible notion that would ensure his cooperation.<br><br> 
"It is a dangerous game you're playing. Fine. You will have your protection, Warlock. I accept your terms. But know this, Malakai. All who oppose the Crimson One will meet their end. It is time for the Hell's Rebel to meet his demise."<br><br>
