				<h3>What's going on, readers. The name is Kurt "Gunrose" Sunderland. I am an artist, as well as the author of the upcoming Compendium of the Astral series of fantasy books, along with the historical fantasy novel, Crownlands. I'm mostly an introverted person in real life, but since you've come here and everything, I figure I'll tell you a bit more about myself. The progress of my art and writing has intertwined throughout my childhood and later years. As such, I'll share some history of both from the beginning.<br><br>

Born and raised in Oakland, California, I've been writing and drawing since I could start forming sentences. My genre of choice was often fantasies inspired by the video games I grew up with around the same time. I religiously played many old school 90's classics at home, all thanks to the fact that my older siblings were hardcore "Sega" guys back in the day. My first games were Golden Axe, Sonic the Hedgehog, Space Harrier 2, Mickey Mouse: Castle of Illusion, and Shining in the Darkness, among others.<br><br>

My artwork is also rooted in fighting games; specifically, the artistic side of the fighting game genre. As a casual pencil artist since I was a child, I've always been inspired by "interesting "character designs. If you're well-acquainted with the top fighting game franchises, there's no doubt you respect something about the artwork & visual designs of many of the characters. Not only their visual appearances, but their storylines and movesets can be inspiring in a variety of ways. Many fighting games can easily be considered "works of art"... not only due to the intricate game designs themselves (and many of their brilliant soundtracks), but due to the countless 2D artworks, 3D renders, and animations that were created from scratch by amazingly talented, legendary artists.<br><br>

On that note, major inspirations behind my visual art goes to the master artists who are responsible for some of the most inspiring and skillful video-game art of all time...just to name off a few; Bengus, Akiman, Shinkiro, Edayan, Takuji Kawano, Kinu Nishimura, Daigo Ikeno, Falcoon, Nona, Eiji Shiroi, and Daisuke Ishiwitari, among others.<br><br>

Where the visual design of fighting games is a major inspiration behind my artwork, the other aspect that would go on to inspire my writing would be the fascinating way in which many fighting games tell their stories; not with a big and fancy story mode, but through in-game character interactions that turn your regular versus match into a self-contained narrative. Ryu vs Ken is no longer just an echo match, but an earnest contest of skill between two lifelong friends.<br><br>

These interactions transform regular gameplay into clashes between fated rivals, tests between mentor and student, and even destined battles against a longtime nemesis.<br><br>

I sometimes feel as if I'm crazy when I talk about the storytelling potential of fighting games because it seems like I'm one of the few people who actually cares about story in fighting games. As stated earlier, fighting games to me are all about their characters, and any effort to have characters express themselves is a plus in my book.<br><br>

In that regard, one series that I have to give a particular - and admittedly biased - nod towards is one that I've personally grown up with in my years and would become my favorite - Mortal Kombat. One thing MK does particularly well in, especially in its later installments in the Netherrealm Studios era is its increased focus on narrative and storytelling.<br><br>

What began in Mortal Kombat 9 in 2011 as a full-blown cinematic story experience has expanded into this whole myriad of character interactions. Interactions that flesh out and establish character relationships in a way that Mortal Kombat up until that point had never seen before.<br><br>

What I loved in particular was how every matchup in Mortal Kombat X provided at least one of five unique interactions. This essentially made it so that every single character in MKX had at least one thing to say about every other character. From the perspective of an "OG" fan of Mortal Kombat since the 2D titles - which relied on a different syle of storytelling in an old traditional arcade ladder format communicating its character lore through text, that in itself is pretty damn amazing. The later MK games have done well to establish factions, friendships, rivalries, alliances, and even budding romances.<br><br>

And speaking of fighting games with defined character ties that also happen to have finishing moves, we also can't forget Arc System Works. Their fighting games, especially Guilty Gear and BlazBlue also definitely deserve shout-out as an inspiration. While both series have some....complex stories....they definitely warrant praise for how their stories also flesh out which characters are related, running the gamut of friends-in-training, fathers and sons, lovers and spouses, co-workers, etc. You really got the sense that BB's characters seemed to have relationships with one another; all of it shown in even more detail within an ambitious multi-path story mode with its own world-building and complicated lore spanning several mediums. In addition, the slow and deliberate Visual Novel-esque pacing of that story gave a nice contrast with that game's insanely fast gameplay, which made for a nice breather from the action.<br><br>

For my first novel - Umbral Siren, among my primary visions was that I wanted to make a story based on all of these unique aspects of fighting game storytelling, and expand on that potential via literary form. I wanted to write a story where not only would its multiple characters intertwine within one another's plotlines around a central setup, but given the inspiration, the fight scenes between these characters would be both prevalent and a priority in and of themselves.<br><br>

However a big inspiration as fighting games are, the story that would become Umbral Siren would also not be what it is in its current form if it weren't for the multitude of books, movies, and works of art in other mediums that I also absorbed in my youth. When constructing and writing the story of what became Umbral Siren around my high-school years, my secondary goal was to mark out my own branch of a supernatural action/horror story, only with more emphasis on the psychological horror aspect. In order to do so, I looked at and studied an extensive collection of works by masters in the fields of horror, storytelling, and film-making, the majority of these being Western works of art.<br><br>

One of the largest contributors to my collection of literary inspirations is Stephen King. King has become so widely-recognized as a master of the horror genre, that most of his writing has been adapted for film and television. In his book about horror fiction, Dense Macabre, Stephen King describes three different types of horror: Terror, Horror, and Revulsion. While Horror and Revulsion are visceral reactions to monsters jumping out or aliens bursting through chests, as well as blood and gore in general, terror is a psychological effect we feel when imagining the horrors to come. It is this psychological terror of Stephen King's books, along with the lore of his stories that inspired me. Other inspirations include Dean Koontz, Robert McGammon, Ira Levin, Richard Matheson, David Lynch's Twin Peaks, Alejandro Jodorowski, Roger Zelazny, Nnedi Okorafor, Octavia Butler, and others.<br><br>

Aside from all of the above, I enjoy researching early Medieval European and African history; particularly West African kingdoms (Mali Empire, Songhai, Oyo, Benin, Ghana, Ashanti) and the early kingdoms of Western Europe after the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire (Frankish-Germanic tribes, Anglo-Saxons, Merovingians, Carolingians, the Danes, Visigoths). I also have an eclectic taste in music - (early 90s rap, RnB, 80s Rock and alternative, 80s Japanese funk, smooth jazz, New Age, Vaporwave), practice Bujinkan Taijutsu, read about politics and philosophy, have an interest in Tarot, and make mischief with friends while going out of town or state on occasion.<br><br>
